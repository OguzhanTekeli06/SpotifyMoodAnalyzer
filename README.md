## üé∂ Spotify Mood Prediction with ASP.NET Core MVC & Flask API
This ASP.NET Core MVC application integrates with the Spotify API to fetch audio features of recently played tracks. It sends these features to a Flask API hosting a machine learning model, which predicts the user's mood (e.g., happy, sad) based on listening habits.

## üîß Features
Spotify API Integration: Retrieves audio features like valence, energy, and tempo.
Mood Prediction: Uses a Flask API model to predict emotional states.
Interactive Dashboard: Displays mood insights on the web interface.
## üìÅ Project Structure
Model: Flask API hosts the machine learning model for mood prediction.
View: ASP.NET Core MVC views display user mood predictions and data.
Controller: Manages data flow between Spotify, Flask API, and the frontend.
